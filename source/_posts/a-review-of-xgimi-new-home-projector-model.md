### Xgimi H2 Global Version Unboxing

XGIMI, a famous Chinese manufacturer of home projectors, recently released a new global projector model, H2 screenless TV. I heard about XGIMI H2 projector included Android operating system and the effect of listening to the Harman Kardon sound from one tiny box. So, on Black Friday, I bought the XGIMI H2 [home projector] (https://www.xgimi.com/en/H2-immersive-home-projector.html) on its official website. Through this article, you will come to know my actual feedback on the latest projector model of XGIMI.

#### Unboxing

When open the package, what comes into my eyes is a small white cardboard box, with an XGIMI logo on its front. On the top center there writes a H2. The minimalistic design of the box shows its high-class style and gives pleasant visual effect. Open the box, and the projector fits in it.

The projector inherits the premium and retro style of H series, which once won several awards from Reddot, IF and CES Best of Innovation. The upper, lower and back panels are made of black matte plastic. On the front of the projector, we can see the XGIMI logo on the lens cover. Now, it’s automatic, which saves us the trouble of manual switch. At the same time, it can effectively prevent dust or other damages to the lens.

On the top side, at first glance, there is a red line serves not only as the decoration of the projector, but also as sliding touch adjustment volume button. The four buttons near the red line are Play/Pause, Seek Forward, Sound Mode, and Power Button.

#### Image Quality Performance

With the simple installation, then we are ready to start using it.
To check the brightness of the XGIMI H2 and the picture quality performance, we selected photos (right) and projected them on the wall (left). Through the comparison of the pictures, we can see that the display of the XGIMI H2 is fine and clear, showing great details and vivid colors.

#### Video Performance

Now let’s see the video performance of XGIMI H2. We pulled the curtain and contrast the two.
XGIMI uses the motion compensation technology and high-performance CPU and GPU, the video playback is smooth and clear, and some high-speed braking scenes and ball photography have no smearing and jitter. At the same time, HDR10 decoding and variable aperture are supported, the details are more abundant, and the details of the light and dark are in place. H2 projector can also support good 3D experience if 3D glasses additionally.

#### Some Functions Impress Me Most

**- Motion Compensation Technology**
Compared with other projectors, H2 smart projector is based on motion compensation technology! Hence you can smoothly watch the movies having subtitles without any issues like jitters or smears. I need to say, H2 will be the best for those who are preparing themselves to take the best experience of World Cup.

**- Harman Kardon Stereo**
Harman Kardon, an American manufacturer of home audio and car audio equipment, is famous for its high-quality sound experience. I am very surprised that this projector has built-in Harman Kardon 's speakers, supporting stereo surround, with a two-way passive bass diaphragm.

#### Conclusion

After a few times of use, the XGIMI H2 impressed me with its compact size, high-quality video and audio performances. So, it could be put anywhere, and if there was enough space, you can even make a home theater!
